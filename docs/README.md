# Strata

**Strata** is a modular platform built around a simple idea: complex systems are easier to understand, scale, and trust when they are designed as **layers**.

Each layer has a clear responsibility. Together, they form a coherent whole.

## The Strata Platform

Strata is composed of tightly integrated services that work together as a single system rather than a collection of unrelated tools.

At its core, Strata is designed around three fundamental concerns:

- **Persistence** — what must endure  
- **Telemetry** — what must be observed  
- **Orchestration** — what must be directed  

These concerns map directly to the three primary Strata services.

## StrataSave — Persistence

**StrataSave** is the foundation of the platform.

It is responsible for **durable state**:
- user or system data
- progress and configuration
- snapshots and long-lived records

StrataSave answers the question:

> *What must not be lost?*

This layer prioritizes reliability, continuity, and long-term integrity. Everything else in the system depends on its stability.

---

## StrataLog — Telemetry

**StrataLog** is the observational layer.

It captures **what is happening** across the system:
- events
- metrics
- traces
- behavioral signals

StrataLog answers the question:

> *What is actually happening?*

By providing visibility into system behavior, StrataLog enables analysis, debugging, insight, and improvement.

---

## StrataHub — Orchestration

**StrataHub** is the coordinating layer and primary human interface.

It manages:
- user access and identity
- relationships between services
- configuration and administration
- dashboards and control surfaces

StrataHub answers the question:

> *What should happen next?*

It is where intent, policy, and decision-making come together.

---

## A Layered System by Design

Strata is not a set of standalone products.  
It is a **stacked system**, where each layer builds on the one below it:

- Without persistence, nothing endures.
- Without telemetry, nothing is understood.
- Without orchestration, nothing is directed.

This layered approach makes Strata:
- easier to reason about
- easier to extend
- easier to operate over time

---

## One Platform, One Identity

Because StrataSave, StrataLog, and StrataHub are layers of a single system, they share a **single core identity**.

The Strata logo represents this architecture directly:
- a stable foundation
- distinct layers
- increasing refinement and control toward the top

Differentiation between services happens through **function and context**, not fragmented branding.

---

## Philosophy

Strata is built on the belief that good systems should feel:
- grounded
- understandable
- intentional
- durable

The platform favors clarity over cleverness, structure over sprawl, and long-term coherence over short-term convenience.

## In One Sentence

**Strata persists what matters, observes what happens, and orchestrates what comes next.**
